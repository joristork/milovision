Milovision: A camera pose estimation programme
==============================================

Introduction
------------

Milovision is a pose estimation pipeline that turns images of a known circular
marker into estimates of the camera's position and rotation relative to that
marker. For information on the mathematical principle on which this pipeline is
based, refer to `report.pdf`.

How to use
----------

Refer to "report.pdf"'s "implementation" chapter for a description and short
user manual.

To try the application, edit, make executable, and run the convenience script,
"run", or type "python main.py -h".
