Milovision: A camera pose estimation programme
==============================================

Introduction
------------

Milovision is a pose estimation pipeline that turns images of a known circular
marker into estimates of the camera's position and rotation relative to that
marker. For information on the mathematical principle on which this pipeline is
based, refer to `report.pdf`.

How to use
----------

Refer to the *Implementation* chapter of `report.pdf` for a short user manual.

For the impatient: edit, make executable, and run the convenience script, `run`,
or type `python main.py -h`.

Further information
-------------------

Refer to `report.pdf` for background on this project and a discussion of the
merits of this programme.
